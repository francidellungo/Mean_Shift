# Mean Shift
Project for the Parallel Computing exam at the University of Florence.

[Mean shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_shift) clustering algorithm is an unsupervised clustering algorithm.
It aims to discover “blobs” in a smooth density of samples. It is a centroid-based algorithm, which works by updating candidates for centroids to be the mean of the points within a given region.
