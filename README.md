[Mean shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_shift) clustering algorithm is an unsupervised clustering algorithm; in particular it is a non-parametric clustering  method based on kernel-density estimation.
It aims to discover “blobs” in a smooth density of samples. It is a centroid-based algorithm, which works by updating candidates for centroids to be the mean of the points within a given region.
